Combined comparison of DuckDuckGo vs multiple Google JSONs.
- given: average percent overlap = 13.4, average Spearman coefficient = 0.14900000000000002 (over 100 queries with data).
- live: average percent overlap = 14.9, average Spearman coefficient = 0.067 (over 100 queries with data).
Notes: Overlap% uses 10 as the denominator (Google's top-10). Spearman is computed only on overlapping URLs; in this assignment variant, values may fall outside [-1,1]. Blank cells indicate the query was not present in that Google JSON.
